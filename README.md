# DevOps and Development Environments

## DevOps

Responsible for tying teams together in software engineering lifecycle. Shared responsibility.

CLOUD
- engine of internet
- very secure (google datacenter)
- protecting user info very important
- warm 80F helps with efficiency
- overhead power distribution
- custom server rack that can be optimised for high speed computing
- drives destroyed if unreliable
- cool water through coils, keep datacenter cool.

4 areas to improve dev ops
- Ease of use:
Other teams wont use the tools we create if they aren't user friendly. If devs do not use our tools there will be headaches and delays in deployment down the line.

- Flexibility:
It can be wasy to get locked in to using a specific product, tool or software. Makes it harder for the company to keep up with industry changes.
Everything should be easy to change and update if needed for the business.

- Robustness:
We need as close to 100% uptime as possible for our company's services.
We are responsible for achieving this as DevOps engineers.

- Cost:
Cost is often overlooked. We need to make sure the company is being as efficient as possibe in it's tech dealings.
For example how powerful a machine fow we need to conduct a task. Do we need certain servers running?etc.

Monoliths - not flexible/or robust

- Risk register:
Highlights risks in system. Outlines potential damagesa, chance of occurence and risk to business.
